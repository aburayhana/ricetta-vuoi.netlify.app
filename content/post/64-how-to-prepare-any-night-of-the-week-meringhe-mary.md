Solution: Make sure the pie filling is hot before you spread meringue over it, then spread to the edges to seal. Hot filling ensures that the inside of the meringue cooks, preventing weeping. Sprinkling fine cake crumbs, vanilla wafer crumbs, or soft white bread crumbs over the filling will absorb liquid between the meringue and the pie filling, which will also prevent weeping. It is believed that they were invented in the Swiss town of Meringen by an Italian chef, Gasparini, between the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries.
